### Assignment Problem Statement:

Make a page (UI is not very important but do not use alert for anything) with text box to take input of IP address.
What ever ip address user enters (first validate it), get its country from https://api.ipstack.com/[ip_address]?access_key=[YOUR_ACCESS_KEY]
Add the IP, country_name and country_code in a Datatable from where IPs or Countries could be search and sorted.

Add an option to delete a row form datatable.
